Project Overview
This end-to-end Power BI project involved transforming raw sales and returns data into a fully interactive, professional dashboard. The objective was to uncover actionable insights into key business trends, with a strong focus on year-over-year (YoY) performance analysis, employee performance, and modern UI/UX best practices.

Key Skills Demonstrated
Data Preparation & Cleaning: Utilized Power Query to combine multiple CSV files, correct data types, replace values, and merge datasets.

Data Modeling: Designed and implemented a robust star schema with a central fact table and dimension tables for People and Dates.

Advanced DAX Calculations: Wrote complex DAX measures, including time-intelligence functions (SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR) to calculate YoY metrics for Return Rate, Average Return Value, and Return Count.

Interactive Visualization: Built a clean, modern dashboard with a dark theme, featuring KPI cards, trend lines, bar charts, and slicers for a fully interactive user experience.

Data Storytelling & Insight Generation: Extracted and presented clear, actionable insights from the data.

Data Sources
The datasets for this project included:

Orders Data: Multiple CSV files (orders2014.csv, orders2015.csv, orders2016.csv)

People Data: An Excel sheet mapping salespersons to their regions.

Returns Data: An Excel sheet detailing returned Order IDs.

Key Insights from the Dashboard
The Problem is Quantity, Not Value: While the total number of returns increased year-over-year, the average monetary value of those returns decreased. This suggests the issue lies with high-volume, low-cost products.

A Seasonal Issue Was Identified: Performance in October 2016 was a significant outlier, pointing to a probable product or campaign-specific problem that needs immediate investigation.

Performance is Concentrated: The data shows that returns are not evenly distributed, with specific employees and regions (like Anna in the West) having a much higher return rate than others, highlighting opportunities for targeted training.
